abstract = {Statistics show that water impact of an aircraft in emergency is likely to have tragic consequences and therefore new researches on this topic are recommendable. In 2005, the GARTEUR AG15 was established to improve the SPH method for application to helicopter ditching. As a contribution, water impact drop tests using rigid bodies were performed at the Politecnico di Milano LAST Crash Lab to collect data and validate the numerical models. During the tests, impact decelerations were measured and suitably pressure transducers were developed to measure the impact pressures. Numerical simulations were carried out by adopting the SPH method to model the fluid region. A close experimentalenumerical correlation was obtained. Findings are reported and guidelines for further investigations are proposed.},

@article{Batty2008,
abstract = {We present a fully implicit Eulerian technique for simulating free surface viscous liquids which eliminates arti- facts in previous approaches, efficiently supports variable viscosity, and allows the simulation of more compelling viscous behaviour than previously achieved in graphics. Our method exploits a variational principle which auto- matically enforces the complex boundary condition on the shear stress at the free surface, while giving rise to a simple discretization with a symmetric positive definite linear system. We demonstrate examples of our technique capturing realistic buckling, folding and coiling behavior. In addition, we explain how to handle domains whose boundary comprises both ghost fluid Dirichlet and variational Neumann parts, allowing correct behaviour at free surfaces and solid walls for both our viscous solve and the variational pressure projection of Batty et al.},

In contrast to commonly employed projection approaches that strictly enforce incompressibility, time-consuming solvers for the Poisson equation are avoided by allowing for small, user-defined density fluctuations. We also discuss an improved surface tension model that is particularly appropriate for single-phase free-surface flows. The proposed model is compared to existing models and experiments illustrate the accuracy of the approach for free surface flows. Combining the proposed methods, volume-preserving low-viscosity liquids can be efficiently simulated using SPH. The approach is appropriate for medium-scale and small-scale phenomena. Effects such as splashing and breaking waves are naturally handled.},

abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a numerical method commonly used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate complex free-surface flows. Simulations with this mesh-free particle method far exceed the capacity of a single processor. In this paper, as part of a dual-functioning code for either central processing units (CPUs) or Graphics Processor Units (GPUs), a parallelisation using GPUs is presented. The GPU parallelisation technique uses the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) of nVidia devices. Simulations with more than one million particles on a single GPU card exhibit speedups of up to two orders of magnitude over using a single-core CPU. It is demonstrated that the code achieves different speedups with different CUDA-enabled GPUs. The numerical behaviour of the SPH code is validated with a standard benchmark test case of dam break flow impacting on an obstacle where good agreement with the experimental results is observed. Both the achieved speed-ups and the quantitative agreement with experiments suggest that CUDA-based GPU programming can be used in SPH methods with efficiency and reliability.},

In this paper we present an efficient approach to perform this task using a novel view-space discretization of the simulation domain. Our method draws upon recent work on GPU-based particle voxelization for the efficient resampling of particles into uniform grids. We propose a new technique that leverages a perspective grid to adaptively discretize the view-volume, giving rise to a continuous level-of-detail sampling structure and reducing memory requirements compared to a uniform grid. In combination with a level-of-detail representation of the particle set, the perspective grid allows effectively reducing the amount of primitives to be processed at run-time. We demonstrate the quality and performance of our method for the rendering of fluid and gas dynamics SPH simulations consisting of many millions of particles.},

In the particular case of computational fluid dynamics, the model is beginning to reach a maturity that allows carrying out detailed quantitative comparisons with laboratory experiments. Here the state-of-the-art of the classical SPH formulation for free-surface flow problems is described in detail. This is demonstrated using dam-break simulations in 2-D and 3-D. The foundations of the method will be presented using different derivations based on the method of interpolants and on the moving least-squares approach. Different methods to improve the classic SPH approach such as the use of density filters and the corrections of the kernel function and its gradient are examined and tested on some laboratory cases},

This avoids typ- ical grid artifacts and maintains the Lagrangian nature of SPH by directly transferring pressures onto particles. Our method can be easily integrated with existing SPH techniques such as the incompressible PCISPH method as well as weakly compressible SPH by adding an additional force term.We show that this hybrid method accelerates convergence towards uniform density and permits a significantly larger time step compared to earlier approaches while producing similar results. We demonstrate our approach in a variety of scenarios with significant pressure gradients such as splashing liquids.},

@inproceedings{Zhang2011,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics(SPH) implementation algorithm on Multi-GPU which is used for physics-based interactive fluid animations by the parallel framework. We employ the SPH method of a particle-based pure Lagrangian approach to discretize Navier-Stockes equation for diverse fluid animations. In order to simulate the incompressibility of liquid to the utmost extent while assuring numerical stability of the system, we use a improved Tait equation to compute pressure. For low computational expense of each simulation step, combining the characteristics between the CPU and GPU, we introduce index sort neighborhood search method which uses CUDA architecture and eliminates GPU memory overhead and saves searching time. In order to get some vivid and interactive fluid effects, we apply an image spaced method to capture the refractive effect and an adaptive method to generate the caustic map for each light. The implementation has been highly optimized to the point where a scaled simulation can run in real-time with CUDA. On the Multi-GPU platform, we obtain good acceleration and high quality rendering effect. In the conclusion, we demonstrate the quality and performance of our method for animating different scale and scene fluid interactive experiments.},
